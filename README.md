![image](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/5f442c709652d998.png)

### Instructions
1. Download the project materials from this link, or from the link at the bottom of the page, and unzip it.

2. cd into the ==dlnd-Daniel-first-network== folder that you just unzipped.


3. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson.

4. Create a new conda environment:
> conda create --name dlnd python=3

5. Enter your new environment:
	Mac/Linux:
	> source activate dlnd

	Windows:
	> activate dlnd

6. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
	> conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

7. Run the following to open up the notebook:

	> jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb

8. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.

9. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook before you submit the project!

## Project 2 : Object Recognition

## Introduction
> In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.

### If you are curious about this project, you can view the [any kinds of soultion](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#43494641522d3130). Deep Learning is not just mathematic and coding. You need to read a lot of paper to inspire you (Trust me, reding paper is important for learning deep learning. You can find [awesome depp learning fromhere](https://github.com/MachineLearningJourney/awesome-deep-learning-papers)). Everyday, I will spend 30 mins on reding paper in the train.

# Project 3 : Generate TV Scripts

![image](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/19a25dcfc375bfec.png)


### Introduction

> In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

### Getting the project files
>The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git
```

> This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

## Language Translation

### Introduction
> In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

### Getting the project files
> The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the language-translation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer
